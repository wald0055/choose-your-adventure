# A New Beginning

"Let's do this this s***" you answer eagerly.

"Well then," says Andrew, "lets get to work."

You dap up Andrew and go around and meet your new crew.
You never expected to end up here in life, but you know now that this is your calling.
You are different after all, and if not you, who else could fill this role.

This is your duty, and you are willing to leave everything behind.

As you look around one more time at all your new comrades, you feel no doubt that this was what you were born to do.

You are finally happy.

# The End.
