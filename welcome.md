# Life Is Good

As you dap up the rhino, you realize you have no idea what you were just welcomed into.
Looking around the room though, you are filled with a sense of belonging and purpose you were missing in your life before this.

A wise old koala with the snazziest gold watch you've ever seen then walks up to you and introduces himself.
"What's up, the name is Andrew, welcome home my son."

As you thank Andrew the koala for taking you in you cant help but get lost deep in thought.
"Was this where I was meant to end up in life? Surrounded by cool animals dripped out in gold?"
But as you look around one more time at all your new comrades, all that doubt begins to fade away.

You may not know exaclty what is going on, or why you are even here, but you are happy.

# The End.
