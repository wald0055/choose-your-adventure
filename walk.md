# B.R.B.

Decisions can be hard sometimes so before making such a big one you turn around and decide to go on a quick walk around the lake.
As you walk, you suddenly feel all the stress you felt before melt away.
As you listen to the calm water next to you, and the birds chirping overhead, you cant help but feel like this is what living is all about.
These little moments are what make it all worth it.

Feeling refreshed you decide to head back to where you started and make your big decision.

On your left you have a tall strong rhino giving away free gold chains, To your right, a narrow dirt path leads away from the lake and into a quiet stretch of land where the sounds of distant music echo through the air.

You feel a calming push in both directions
