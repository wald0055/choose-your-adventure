# The Mysterious Door

You open the door and walk through.
There is nothing but darkness surrounding you, except for a small glowing item on a pedestal far into the room.
As you approach it you immediately realize exactly what it is.

AN ICE COLD BEER!

As you look at it, mouth watering, you contemplate why it was glowing?
But after a quick brainstorming break, you realize something.
You can't think on an empty stomach! 

What do you do next?
