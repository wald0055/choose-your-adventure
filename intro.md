The beginning

You wake up to a beautiful sunset beside a warm, glowing lake. The sky is painted in shades of orange and purple, and the air feels calm.
On your left you have a tall strong rhino giving away free gold chains, To your right, a narrow dirt path leads away from the lake and into a quiet stretch of land where the sounds of distant music echo through the air.

You feel a pull in both directions

What do you do next?
