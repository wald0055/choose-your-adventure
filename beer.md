# Chug! Chug! Chug!

You slowly reach for the beer, uneasy, but certain this is the correct choice.
As it meets your hand, you suddenly hear a faint voice whispering something to you, but you cant quite make out what it's saying.
You dart your head around quickly, but there is no one else in this darkness with you.
As you listen closer, you figure out what this disembodied voice is trying to say.

It's whispering, "Chug."

Scared for what will happen if you dont take a sip, you crack it open and start chugging.
As the beer gets emptier, the voices get louder.
Then as the final drops exit the can...

"CONGRATULATIONS! YOU PASSED THE INITIATION TEST!"

You look around at a bright white party room full of animals dressed head to toe in gold apparel.
The rhino then walks up to you and reaches out his hand.
