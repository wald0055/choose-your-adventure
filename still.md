# What's Going On?

As you look both left and right you feel your stomach drop.
You never were good at making decisions, it's a flaw you've had your whole life.
But now faced with a life changing decision such as this, you completely freeze up.

"What's going on? I can't move a single muscle!" you think to yourself.

You stand there unable to move, as if you are frozen in time, but the world continues to move around you.
At first its only minutes, but it eventually becomes hours, then days, then months, then years.

"I just need a second! I just need more time to think about it!"
But that time never comes.
Sometimes you just have to make a leap of faith and take a risk, because at the end of the day...

Time stops for nobody.
