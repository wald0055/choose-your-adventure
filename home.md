# No Thanks!

"I'd prefer to go home, this is all too much for me." you respond.

Andrew looks disappointed.
"Are you sure this is what you want, the whole world could be at stake here"

But you have already made up your mind.
All this talking animals in gold versus dark shadow figures business is just too much for you.
You are just a plain ol average joe, nothing too special about you, and you aren't ready to risk your life over this.

"I'm good!" you say.

Andrew nods, then walks up to you, removing your gold chain.
As soon as the chain leaves your body everything suddenly fades to black.

Then you wake up, nice and comfy in your bed.
"Was it all a dream?" you wonder.
Deep down you know you'll never get an answer to that question, but you are okay with that.

Some questions are better left unanswered.

# The End.
