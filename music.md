# Following the Music

You step onto the narrow dirt path, letting the distant music guide you forward. With every step, the melody grows clearer. A deep bass mixed with unfamiliar instruments, vibrating through the ground beneath your feet.

The lake slowly disappears behind you, and things get much more eerie. Whatever you're hearing, isn't right. It isn't safe...

You pause, feeling uneasy.

What do you do next?
