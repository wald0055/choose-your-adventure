# Run for the hills

You turn around and start booking it.
You may not be able to think clearly right now but you do know that this seems way too sketchy.
As you run towards the door though you realize it seems like its getting further and further away.
But as you keep running, the gold chain you were gifted starts to glow, and suddenly you feel the ground underneath you disappear.

As you fall down a pit that you can swear wasnt there before, you are left with nothing but your thoughts.

After what feels like minutes you can't help but think "Man, this hole sure is deep".
Thats when the rhino appears out of thin air next to you.
He gives you a disapproving headshake as both him and the gold chain slowly fade into dust.

"I should've just taken a swig." is the only thing that crosses your mind as you fall for an eternity, just hoping there is a bottom to this pit.
