# What's Going On Right Now?

As the rhino approaches you, you take a step back.  
You can see the disappointment on his face, but deep down, you can tell he understands.

"What the hell is going on here?!" you yell.

"Don't worry, my son. My name is Andrew. I'm the leader around these parts—let me explain real quick," says an old, wise-looking koala, wearing the snazziest gold watch you've ever seen.
"We are what are known as *The Cleaners*," he says.  
"We are here to rid the world of darkness. It's why we wear gold to outshine it."

"But what does that have to do with me?" you ask.

"You've heard it, haven't you, the distant music calling your name."

Your stomach drops.

"The darkness takes many shapes, but its main goal is to lure people in and replace them. They use that charming music you heard to trap their victims. But you are different. You can help us stop them."

With a stomach full of nerves, you question if you really are different.  
Can you really stop this evil they’re talking about?
Before you can think any further, Andrew speaks again.

"So, what do you say? You in?"
