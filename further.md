# Is Anyone There?

You swallow your fear and keep moving, drawn in by the strange, haunting melody.
The air grows colder with every step, and the trees seem to lean inward, blocking out what little light remains.

Suddenly, the music stops.

The silence is worse.

Before you can react, something cold and metallic quickly smacks you over the head and you begin to pass out.
As you slowly close your eyes though, you can briefly make out a figure looming over you.
With the last of your strength you focus your vision to see clearer.
The figure weirdly resembles... 

You?

Then everything goes black.

You wake up in a dark pit.
Looking up, you realize there's no way back out.

The music then begins again, this time, all around you.

You should have just turned back.


# The End.
